    "## 1.2 Data Collection & General Information\n",
    "The National Sleep Foundation counducted an online survey study on sleep of Americans in December 2014 and obtained answers from 1,029 non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years or older who reside in the United States. The survey asked participants about their sleep quality, attitude toward sleep, time spent in bed, estimate of actual sleep obtained, how much do they think certain factors affect their sleep quality, etc.\n",
    "Participants were selected via representative random sampling on GfK's KnowledgePanel. The KnowledgePanel initially used the Delivery Sequence File (DSF) of the United States Postal Service as the sampling frame to recruit panalists. The DSF covers almost 100% of the U.S. population. \n",
    "The study also asked participants about their perception of various types of pain. To narrow our area of interest for this project, we only used questions asking directly about sleep.   \n",
    "Because this dataset is survey data, by using it, we assume that participants' answer reflect their true situations. "

    "## 1.3 Objective\n",
    "College students, including our team members, experience unsatisfactory sleep quality. Especially during exam periods, our peers often express similar concerns as ourselves, that is, we do not have 'good' sleep. Accordingly, we feel tired and hard to concentrate, or maybe even experience decreasing life quality. \n",
    "One thing that we have noticed is that with the increasing usage of mobile phones, we spent quite a considerable amount of time messing with our phone in bed before actually falling asleep and after waking up. Such behavior decreased our sleep effciency, that is, the proportion of time in bed actually spent on sleeping.  \n",
    "Thus, we wonder whether sleeping efficiency has a relationship with sleep quality, as well as what are other factors that affect sleep quality. "
